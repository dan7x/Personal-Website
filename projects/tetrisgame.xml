<subtitle>Overview</subtitle>
<text>I really liked Tetris, which is why I chose to make this game for this project.</text>
<text>Here is some gameplay:</text>

<text>The (very messy) code for this project can be found !nb href="https://github.com/dan7x/ICS2O-Tetris"!rb here!cl.
    I did the best I could to mimic the gamemodes of Tetris Friends (RIP). To implment the piece rotations,
    I basically hardcoded where each block should move.

<text>The games I made !lb href="/projects/amongusrunner"!rb later on !cl are way better, and are at least somewhat original.</text>
