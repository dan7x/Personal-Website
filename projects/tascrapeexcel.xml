    In short, I made script that pulls my grades from the TeachAssist website and plops everything into a spreadsheet.
    This made it really easy for me to calculate my grades whenever I wanted.

<text>I'm no longer a YRDSB student, but the script worked as of June 2021. If they updated the page, it may not work anymore.
    The code can be found !lb href="https://github.com/dan7x/ExcelTA" !rb here!cl if you're interested.
