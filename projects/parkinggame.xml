<subtitle>Overview</subtitle>
<text>Here's a game I made in grade 11 as my final ICS3U project.</text>

<text>Since it was made for a school project, the aim was not to make the game fun and addictive to play, but rather
    to show that I understood all the programming concepts. For this reason, I focused on a breadth of functionality
    (i.e., providing realism with gear shifts, custom map editior, settings variety, etc.) as opposed to making the 
    game playable for a general audience.

<text>The original idea was to make a racing game, but I ended up running out of time,
    so I scrapped the minimap that I made for the racing game and turned it into
    a !nb href="https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-parkingmania"!rb Parking-Mania !cl copy by adding
    in a few hitboxes. My !lb href="/projects/amongusrunner"!rb grade 12 project !cl was magnitudes
    better, with 3D graphics and actual fun playability.</text>
