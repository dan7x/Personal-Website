<subtitle>Overview</subtitle>
<text>My grade 12 final computer science project was to make a game in Java. To make it extra
     cool, I made it in 3D. Here is some gameplay:

<text>The (very messy) code for this project can be found !nb href="https://github.com/dan7x/ICS4U-Red-Astro-Man-Game"!rb here!cl. The mechanics are similar to Temple Run, where the player needs to avoid obstacles on an endless scrolling platform.</text>
<subtitle>3D Models</subtitle>
<text>I used a mix of my own 3D models and ones that I found online. 
    You can find the models !nb href="https://github.com/dan7x/ICS4U-Red-Astro-Man-Game/blob/main/README.md"!rb here!cl.
    The models I made myself were created in !nb href="https://www.blender.org/"!rbBlender!cl.
